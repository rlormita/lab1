Hello guys! I'm Rommel Ormita and I'm from New Lower Bicutan, Taguig City.<br>
</p>

<p style="margin:150px"   align="justify">
The story that I gonna tell you with, was the time when I was in SHS and we had a groupings in Novaliches, Quezon City.
In PUP Main, students come from different cities, and some are from provinces. When we are having groupings, 
mostly PUP is our meeting place (since it is open from Mon-Sat), because it will be fair to my groupmates to travel.
But there was a time when all of my groupmates are from the Northern part of Metro Manila, and majority agreed to meet at one of my classmate's house at Novaliches. 
Of course, the only one being in the south, had no choice but to agree with it.
It was my first time to travel that far and I don't know how to go there.
</p>
<p style="margin:150px" align="justify">
My classmate gave me instructions which was I need to take MRT and a UV express. 
Going there was very tiring because it is almost a 2hr travel.
I was also nervous that time because I might get lost but with the power of asking questions,
I reached the house of my classmate at Novaliches. But when we need to go home, 
there was a bus going to Alabang and has a stopover at Bicutan that passes outside their subdivision. 
I was shocked that my classmate didn't told me this, because it would save money and time for me. 
So, I took the bus and got home safely, feeling proud that I traveled from Taguig-Novaliches, Novaliches-Taguig.
</p>
<p>
<p style="margin:150px" align="justify">
On the time when I'm commuting at Novaliches. I am contemplating that if PUP was a good choice to study SHS because it's very tiring to commute. 
But eventually I realized that it is good choice because I get to go to different places in Metro Manila and Outside Metro Manila.
</p>
<p>
<p style="margin:150px" align="justify">
I expect that that this class will be very fun and challenging and
I will fully learn about UI/UX that it will be serve me as a foundation to be a better IT specialist.
